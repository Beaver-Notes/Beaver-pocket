# Beaver-notes-pocket

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ 

Welcome to the Beaver Notes Pocket repository. I am the sole developer behind Beaver Notes, and currently, this mobile app operates as a basic text editor. It offers a sneak peek into the potential future of Beaver Notes on mobile devices. Any contribution to the Beaver Notes project is highly welcomed, as more than one person is needed to maintain both the desktop and mobile app. So, if you happen to be of help, please don't hesitate to tinker with the mobile app; your contribution might be crucial for the continuation of the Beaver Notes Pocket project and even Beaver Notes itself.

> [!WARNING] 
> Please be aware that this application is not suitable for use as a note-taking app in its current state.
> This repository is primarily for demonstration and development purposes only. It should not be relied upon as a functional note-taking app until further development has been completed.
